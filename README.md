# HotCiv
A class project using TDD (Fall '14)

To run the project and to play with the games gui, go to test/visual/ and run the show integrationTool
The ant (build.xml) file may also have to be run to copy the gui resource pictures to the correct location.

Some specific files that I worked on: 
    /src/hotciv/tool/tileFocusTool.java
    /src/hotciv/tool/integrationTool.java

*note: many of the jar files are currently broken to my dismay, I am trying to find the source because they all should work. So even thought the tests are broken, the project should run using the above instructions.
